In designing my Amateur Radio Satcom station for V/U Satcom using omnidirectional antennas, I toyed with the idea of using relay-based TX/RX switches with a 3dB power divider to supply a signal to a monitoring SDR without the filters of the IC-9700 in the receive chain. This was an alternative to using the PTRX-9700 Pandapter as a signal cloning device, and it had the added benefit of being able to use more of the M2 Antennas Eggbeaters’ frequency ranges (The Full 136-148MHz and 400-470MHz advertised). Unfortunately, this system configuration resulted in insufficient SNR for decoding much telemetry or other signals in the 146/433 MHz Amateur Radio V/U Satcom Bands wihtout acquiring a mast-mounted pre-amp. Despite this, my quest to explore this technical solution in a world filled with covid-driven part scarcity led to a useful development regarding a common MFJ product.

I fell into the same trap as K1GMM and purchased some MFJ-1708B RF Sense TR Switches thinking they were identical in function to the 3 MFJ-1708B RF Sense SDR Receiver TR Switches. The Switches I bought used a common circuit board design with the SDR model switches, but the non-SDR model did not split the RF receive output. Rather it only served it to only the “REC” output. MFJ, like Ten-Tec, provides schematics for many of their products, so I set out to see if I might easily convert this non-SDR model switch to act as the SDR one.

While the physical circuit boards used for the various models of MFJ-1708B devices are all the same, the populated portions of the layout differ in 4 ways:

1. R1 is NOT present on SDR Version
2. JP3 is disconnected/NOT present on SDR Version
3. SMD Center-Tap Transformer TR1 for the -3dB RF Splitter is present on SDR Version
4. 100 Ohm Resistor shorts end-point leads of TR1 on SDR Version

The differences can be shown schematically between the 2 marked-up schematic images below:

The raw schematics come from the manuals available directly from MFJ:

All of the components required to convert the non-SDR version to the SDR version are likely to be found lying around a typical hobbyist electronics lab except the power splitter transformer, although it's not hard to find something workable for < $5 a piece on DigiKey, Mouser, etc. I measured by hand using a caliper the footprint for the power splitter on the board and sourced a MAPD-011039 2-Way Power Divider capable of covering 1.218MHz to 5 GHz with an insertion loss of 1.2 dB in a 0.163" L x 0.167" W x 0.142" H (4.15mm x 4.25mm x 3.60mm) 6-SMD, No Lead package for $3.58/pc.

Performing these 4 changes shown in the youtube link below successfully made the MFJ-1708B units I bought function as the SDR version RF receive splitting models.
